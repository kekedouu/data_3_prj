This dataset began from the original accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
The average value of each meansurement for each subject and each activity is calculated.

These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they 
were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 
20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration
signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency
of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ,
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals)

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
